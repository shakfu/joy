 file type	:  ->  FILE:.
The type of references to open I/O streams,
typically but not necessarily files.
The only literals of this type are stdin, stdout, and stderr.

stdin	:  ->  S.
[FOREIGN] Pushes the standard input stream.
stdout	:  ->  S.
[FOREIGN] Pushes the standard output stream.
stderr	:  ->  S.
[FOREIGN] Pushes the standard error stream.
 float type	:  ->  F.
The type of floating-point numbers.
Literals of this type are written with embedded decimal points (like 1.2)
and optional exponent specifiers (like 1.5E2).

 list type	:  ->  [...].
The type of lists of values of any type (including lists),
or the type of quoted programs which may contain operators or combinators.
Literals of this type are written inside square brackets.
Examples: []  [3 512 -7]  [john mary]  ['A 'C ['B]]  [dup *].

 string type	:  ->  "...".
The type of strings of characters. Literals are written inside double quotes.
Examples: ""  "A"  "hello world" "123".
Unix style escapes are accepted.

 set type	:  ->  {...}.
The type of sets of small non-negative integers.
The maximum is platform dependent, typically the range is 0..31.
Literals are written inside curly braces.
Examples:  {}  {0}  {1 3 5}  {19 18 17}.

 integer type	:  ->  I.
The type of negative, zero or positive integers.
Literals are written in decimal notation. Examples:  -123   0   42.

 character type	:  ->  C.
The type of characters. Literals are written with a single quote.
Examples:  'A  '7  ';  and so on. Unix style escapes are allowed.

true	:  ->  true.
Pushes the value true.
maxint	:  ->  maxint.
Pushes largest integer (platform dependent). Typically it is 32 bits.
helpdetail	:  [ S1 S2 .. ]  ->.
[IMPURE] Gives brief help on each symbol S in the list.
